description: Definitely not traditionally Mexican, but this is what we grew up with and brings back memories of extra-hot salsa at my grandparents.

recipeCuisine: Mexican

prepTime: PT30M
cookTime: PT30M
recipeYield: 4 people

recipeIngredient:
  For the beef:
  - 400g extra-lean beef
  - 1 tablespoon chili powder
  - ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
  - ¼ teaspoon onion powder
  - ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
  - ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
  - ½ teaspoon paprika
  - 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
  - 1 teaspoon sea salt
  - 1 teaspoon black pepper
  Other fillings:
  - 250g cheddar cheese
  - 1 onion
  - 2 peppers
  - 2 tomatoes, de-seeded
  - Lettuce, for decoration (you might intend to add it, but you never will)
  To serve:
  - 16 taco shells
  - Old El Paso extra-hot salsa
  - Lime (not traditional at all)


recipeInstructions:
- Prepare the non-meat fillings. Grate the cheese (always make more than you think you'll need). Finely dice the rest of the fillings and place in separate bowls. Squeeze a little lime over the onions to keep them fresh.
- Preheat the oven to 200℃ for the taco shells.
- Mix all the spices together in a jar. 
- Brown the beef in a frying pan, adding the spice mix 2/3 of the way through. Remove to a serving bowl.
- Warm the taco shells for 3-5 minutes. They'll be soft when they come out of the oven, and harden up as they cool.
- Put everything out on the table, and dig in.
