name: Pear jam
description: 

# recipeCuisine:
meal: Condiment

prepTime: PT30M
cookTime: PT1H
recipeYield: 2 jars

recipeIngredient:
  - 900g pear flesh (after peeling and coring)
  - 300g caster sugar (1/3 volume of fruit)
  - Juice of 1 lemon
  - 3 cardamom pods

recipeInstructions:
  - Peel & core the pears
  - Chop into small pieces that are perfect for jam. They'll be soft and break down a bit once cooked.
  - Add the pear, sugar and lemon juice, toss, and cover the bowl.
  - Leave for 12-24 hours in the fridge.
  - Transfer to a very large pan. The mixture froths a verylot once it gets hot
  - Heat on medium-high until it reaches 105℃. This takes a while as a lot of moisture will boil off before the temperature rises above 100℃. This is when the foaming happens, and when that stops you need to watch the temperature closely.
  - Meanwhile, sterilise some jam jars.
  - When the mixture reaches 105℃, immediately remove from the heat and transfer to the jars.
  - Leave to cool, and refrigerate/freeze.

It's all about the ratios: add 1/3 the weight of fruit as sugar.
