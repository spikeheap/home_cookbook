recipeIngredient:
- 500g strong white flour
- 300g sourdough starter
- 1 tsp fine salt
- 1 tbsp malt extract or honey
- 225ml warm water

recipeInstructions:
  Prep:
  - Add everything into a large mixing bowl, and stir/mix on slow speed until combined. Add a little extra water if it's too dry.
  - Mix or knead until soft and elastic (10 minutes). The dough is ready when it bounces back when gently pressed with a finger.
  - Leave the dough in a well oiled bowl, covered, to rise for 3 hours. It might not rise much during this time.
  - Line a bowl with a clean, floured tea-towel, or flour a proving basket.
  - Tip the dough out and knead briefly to remove bubbles. Shape into a ball, dust with flour and place into the bowl/basket **seam-side up**.
  - Leave to prove until doubled in size (~8 hours).
  Baking:
    - Put the cast-iron pan in the oven and preheat to 210â„ƒ.
    - Add a small roasting tin of water at the bottom of the oven, to create steam.
    - When preheated, **carefully** tip the dough onto baking paper and place in the cast-iron.
    - Make deep slashes in the top of the loaf.
    - Bake for ~35 minutes until deep brown and hollow-sounding.
    - Remove and allow to cool.
