recipeCuisine: Mexican

prepTime: PT10H
cookTime: PT20M
recipeYield: Serves 2

recipeIngredient:
- 2 red onions
- 1 red pepper
- 1 mild chili
- 100g tomatoes (if you like)
- 50-100g chorizo
- 4 eggs
- dash of milk
- 2-4 wraps
- Cholula hot sauce

recipeInstructions:
  - Slice the onions, pepper, and chili. Halve the cherry tomatoes.
  - Add the onions to a saut√© pan over medium/high heat with a glug of oil, and sprinkle with a little salt to help them brown.
  - Add the chorizo to a small pan with a dash of oil over a medium-high heat. These will brown and want to stick a little, so move them occasionally.
  - When the onions have taken on a little colour, add the pepper, chilli and tomatoes.
  - Once the onions and peppers have softened, but retained a bit of crunch, take them off the heat and add to the wraps. We'll re-use that pan.
  - Add the eggs to the frying pan with a dash of milk over medium heat, scramble, and add to the wraps.
  - Last of all, take the browned chorizo and distribute in the wraps.
  - Add as much hot sauce as you enjoy, and dig in.
