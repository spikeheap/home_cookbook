recipeIngredient:
- 500g strong white flour
- 10g salt
- 7g fast-action yeast, or 18g fresh yeast
- 40g butter, softened
- '1 tbsp malt extract '
- 280ml milk
- 2 oranges, zest only
- '50g poppy seeds '
- oil, for greasing
- 21g bicarbonate of soda
- 20g rock salt
- 50g sesame seeds
- 3 oranges, juice of 3, zest of 1 cut into thin slithers
- 125g sugar
recipeInstructions:
- 'Add the flour, salt, yeast and butter to a bowl. In a jug, add the malt extract
  to the milk and stir to dissolve. Add the milk mixture gradually to the flour and
  mix until a dough is formed. '
- 'Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead. The dough should be stiff
  but not sticky, and shouldn’t need any extra flour to knead. Continue for 10 minutes,
  or until the dough is smooth and glossy. '
- Divide the dough in half. To one half, add the zest of two oranges and the poppy
  seeds, and mix through, ensuring even distribution. Leave the other half plain.
  Place both doughs into separate oiled bowls, cover, and leave to prove until doubled
  in size (about 45 minutes).
- Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.
- Once proved, turn both the doughs out and divide each one into six equal pieces.
  Using your hands, take each piece, and roll the dough into a long sausage shape,
  tapering the ends, and creating a slight bulge in the middle. Each piece should
  be about 40-50cm/16-20in in length. You may need to roll out each of the strands
  just part way at first, then rest them, allowing the glutens to relax, before continuing
  to roll them out to their full length. This can help to prevent the strands springing
  back and creating unevenly shaped pieces. As you roll out the ropes you should apply
  some pressure to the dough, working from the middle outwards, pushing out any air
  bubbles that may have formed in the dough.
- 'The traditional and quickest way to shape a pretzel is to take hold of each end
  of the strand and lift it into the air to create a U-shape. Then, without letting
  go of the ends, and in one swift movement,  flip the centre of the U, propelling
  it to form a double twist. Lay it back down on the work bench and lightly press
  the tapered ends onto the opposite sides of the pretzel, attaching them either side
  of the central bulge. You may find a little dab of water helps to stick the ends
  to the pretzel. Carefully flip the pretzels over and onto a baking tray lined with
  parchment paper, so that the ends are now face down. You should now have a classic
  pretzel shape with three equally spaced sections. '
- Alternatively, shape each rope into a wide U-shape on the work bench. Take the two
  ends and manually twist them around each other twice before fixing the tapered end
  pieces to the opposite sides of the pretzel underneath the main circle of the pretzel
  so that you can’t see the joins. Press down lightly to seal, without misshaping
  the pretzel. Work quickly to shape all 12 pretzels.
- Add the bicarbonate of soda to 7 litres/12½pints of boiling water, and gently drop
  each pretzel into the boiling water for approximately five seconds. Gently remove
  and place on a baking tray, keeping the different flavours separate. While the plain
  dough is still wet from the water, sprinkle over the salt and sesame seeds.
- With a sharp knife, make a deep slash into the thickest part of the dough.
- 'Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are a deep brown colour. '
- Meanwhile make the glaze for the sweet pretzels. Put the orange juice into a saucepan
  and add 100g/3½oz sugar. Add the zest, and bring up to the boil. Boil for one minute,
  then remove the zest using a slotted spoon and roll it in the remaining sugar. Continue
  to cook the syrup until reduced in volume and sticky. Pass through a fine sieve.
- Place the baked pretzels on a wire cooling rack, brush the sweet pretzels with the
  syrup glaze and sprinkle over the candied zest.
