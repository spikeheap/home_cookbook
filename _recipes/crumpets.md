recipeIngredient:
- 175g/6oz strong white flour
- 175g/6oz plain flour
- 2 x 7g sachets instant yeast
- 1 tsp caster sugar
- 350ml/12fl oz warm milk
- 150-200ml/5-7fl oz warm water
- "½ tsp bicarbonate of soda"
- 1 tsp salt
- sunflower oil for cooking
recipeInstructions:
- Weigh the flours in to a bowl. Add the yeast and stir through the flour.
- 'Dissolve the sugar in the warm milk and pour onto the flour. Using a wooden spoon
  beat until you have a smooth batter. This will take 3-4 minutes and is hard work,
  but is essential to produce the holes in the crumpets. '
- 'Cover and leave for at least 20 minutes and up to an hour. The batter will rise
  and then begin to fall. You will see marks on the side of the bowl where the batter
  was before it dropped. '
- Mix the bicarbonate of soda and salt with the warm water and beat it into the batter.  Add
  about ¾ of the water and keep adding it until you get a double cream consistency.
  Cover and rest for 20 minutes.
- 'Heat a flat griddle or heavy based pan. Lightly grease the inside of four metal
  crumpet rings. Lightly grease the griddle. Sit the rings on the griddle over a medium
  heat. '
- 'Drop two dessert spoons of mixture into each ring. After 4-5 minutes bubbles should
  appear and the surface should be set. Carefully turn the crumpets in their rings
  and cook for a further three minutes. '
- 'Serve immediately or leave to cool and then toast before eating with plenty of
  butter. '
