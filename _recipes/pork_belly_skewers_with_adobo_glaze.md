recipeIngredient:
  Barbacoa marinade:
    - 1 kg pork belly slices, cut into 3 cm pieces
    - 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
    - 1 onion, roughly chopped
    - 2 bay leaves
    - 1 tsp soft brown sugar
    - 80ml dark soy sauce
    - 80ml distilled white vinegar
    - 6 black peppercorns, whole
    - 2 red onions
    - 2 (250g) packs pak choi, halved lengthways
    - ½ tbsp olive oil


recipeInstructions:
- Put the pork, garlic, onion, bay leaves, sugar, soy, vinegar, peppercorns and 250ml water in a large, deep pan. Bring to a brisk simmer over a high heat. Cover, reduce to low heat and simmer for 35 mins or until the pork is cooked.
- Light the barbecue 30 mins before you start grilling. If you’re using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 20 mins.
- Remove the pork to a plate to cool. Strain the liquid through a sieve into a clean pan and set aside 60ml for basting. To create the adobo glaze, bring the rest to a simmer and cook over a medium-low heat for 10-12 mins or until reduced and syrupy. Add a splash of vinegar if required to achieve a salty-sour balance. Keep warm.
- Thread the pork onto 8 skewers, alternating with red onion for every 1-2 pieces of meat. Repeat until the pork and onions are used up.
- Barbecue the skewers over direct heat (or cook under a medium-high grill) for 3-5 mins each side, turning often and basting with the reserved 60ml of liquid each time until evenly charred.
- Brush the pak choi with oil and season. Barbecue or grill for 2-3 mins, turning often, until wilted.
- Serve the pork brushed with the warm adobo glaze, with the pak choi and steamed rice, if you like.
