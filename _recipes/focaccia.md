recipeIngredient:
- 500g/1lb 2oz strong white flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 sachet (7g) dried easy blend yeast
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 400ml/14fl oz cold water
- olive oil, for drizzling
- fine sea salt
recipeInstructions:
- Place the flour, salt, yeast, olive oil and 300ml/10Â½fl oz of the water into a large
  bowl. Gently stir with your hand or a wooden spoon to form a dough, then knead the
  dough in the bowl for five minutes, gradually adding the remaining water.
- Stretch the dough by hand in the bowl, tuck the sides into the centre, turn the
  bowl 90 degrees and repeat the process for about five minutes.
- Tip the dough onto an oiled work surface and continue kneading for five more minutes.
  Return the dough to the bowl, cover and leave to rise until doubled in size.
- Line a large baking tray with baking paper. Tip the dough out of the bowl and flatten
  the dough onto the prepared tray, pushing to the corners, cover with a large plastic
  bag, making sure it does not touch the top of the dough, then leave to prove for
  one hour.
- Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Drizzle the loaves with oil, sprinkle with
  fine sea salt then bake in the oven for 20 minutes. When cooked, drizzle with a
  little more olive oil and serve hot or warm.
