recipeIngredient:
- 250g 00 flour (or strong bread flour in a pinch)
- 160ml of water
- 20ml of olive oil
- 5g of fast-acting yeast
- 5g of salt
recipeInstructions:
- Add all the ingredients in a bowl (keeping salt and yeast as separate as possible).
- Mix and knead for 5-10 minutes.
- Leave the dough to rise "from morning to evening", or as long as possible. If you need it sooner, consider slightly more yeast!
- Split into ~150g balls. 
- Prove these for a further 2 hours if possible.
- Spread them out with fingers into 6 to 7 inch circles until they are the same thickness all over. Toss/spin the dough on your knuckles to make the dough to be thinner in the middle and thicker on the edges.
