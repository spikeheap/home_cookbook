- 613 grams “00” flour
- 368 grams lukewarm water
- 3.5 grams active dry yeast, or 2.7 grams instant dried yeast, or 8.5 grams fresh yeast
- 10 grams kosher salt
recipeInstructions:
- Add all the ingredients in a bowl (keeping salt and yeast as separate as possible).
- Mix on slow for 10-15 minutes.
- Shape into a ball and leave to rise in bowl for 2 hours (or until doubled)
- Split into 3 balls. Place in fridge if now if you need to slow things down a bit.
- Leave to rise for another 30-60 minutes (or until doubled). Meanwhile preheat the pizza oven to 450℃.
- To roll, use fingertips to work dough out from centre into a disc, then lift and work around the edges, letting the weight of the dough stretch it out. It wants to be very thin!
