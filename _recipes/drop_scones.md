recipeIngredient:
- 175g/6oz self-raising flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 40g/1½oz caster sugar
- 1 small orange, zest only
- '1 free-range egg '
- 200ml/7fl oz milk
- sunflower oil, for greasing
- butter, maple syrup or honey
- Greek-style yoghurt
- fresh blueberries and raspberries
recipeInstructions:
- 'Place the flour, baking powder, sugar and orange zest in a mixing bowl. Make a
  well in the centre and then add the egg and half of the milk. Beat well with a whisk
  until you have a smooth, thick batter. Beat in enough of the milk to make a batter
  the consistency of thick pouring cream – you may not need all the milk. '
- 'Heat a large non-stick frying pan and grease with a little oil. Drop the mixture
  in dessertspoonfuls onto the hot pan, spacing the mixture well apart to allow for
  them to spread. When bubbles appear on the surface, turn the scones over with a
  palette knife or spatula and cook on the other side for a further 30 seconds to
  1 minute, or until they are lightly golden brown. '
- 'Lift the pancakes on to a wire rack and cover with a clean teatowel to keep them
  soft. Continue cooking the batter in the same way. '
- Serve at once with butter, maple syrup or honey, yoghurt, blueberries, raspberries
  or other seasonal fruits.
