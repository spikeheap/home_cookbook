recipeIngredient:
- For The Dough:
    - 200g Full Fat Milk
    - 2 Medium Eggs
    - 600g Strong White Bread Flour
    - 25g Fresh Yeast
    - 50g Caster Sugar
    - 10g Salt
    - 200g Unsalted Butter

#For The Filling;
- 150g Unsalted Butter
- 250g Soft Brown Sugar
- 2 Tsp Cinnamon

#For The Egg Glaze;
- 1 Egg
- 2 Tbsp Full Fat Milk

# For The Sugar Glaze;
- 100g Caster Sugar
- 100g Water

recipeInstructions:
- Start by making the dough. Put the milk and eggs into the bowl of a food mixer then add the flour. Break in the yeast to one side of the bowl, then add the salt and sugar and butter to the other side
- Mix on a slow speed for 4 minutes then increase the speed to medium and mix for a further 10-12 minutes until the dough comes away cleanly from the side of the bowl.
- Form the dough into a ball and pop into a clean floured bowl. Cover and leave for around 45 minutes or until double in size.
- Lightly flour a work surface and roll the dough into a rectangle roughly the size of an A3 sheet of paper.
- For the filling, beat the butter and sugar together until pale and stir in the cinnamon. Spread the filling over the top of the dough.
- With the long side facing you, fold in half lengthways to enclose the filling and slice it widthways into 12 strips each roughly 3.5cm across. Next, use a sharp knife to cut twice down the length of each strip to make three strands. Plait the three strands together and repeat to make 12 individual plaits.
- Take each plait and roll it up along its length to create a knot. Grease a 12 cup muffin tray and pop the knots into the tray. Cover and allow to prove for 1 hour.
- Aim to have your wood fired oven at around 200Â°C with little to no flame. Brush the knots with the egg glaze and pop into the oven to bake for between 15-20 minutes until golden.
- Meanwhile, make the sugar glaze. Put the sugar and water in a pan and bring to the boil, turn down to a simmer until you have a light syrup.
- Brush the baked knots with the syrup while still hot and leave to cool before devouring.
