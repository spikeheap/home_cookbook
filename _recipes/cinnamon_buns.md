recipeIngredient:
  "For The Dough":
    - 200g Full Fat Milk
    - 2 Medium Eggs
    - 600g Strong White Bread Flour
    - 25g Fresh Yeast
    - 50g Caster Sugar
    - 10g Salt
    - 200g Unsalted Butter
  "For The Filling":
    - 150g Unsalted Butter
    - 250g Soft Brown Sugar
    - 2 Tsp Cinnamon

  For The Egg Glaze:
    - 1 Egg
    - 2 Tbsp Full Fat Milk

  For The Sugar Glaze:
    - 100g Caster Sugar
    - 100g Water

recipeInstructions:
- Add the milk and eggs to the food mixer bowl.
- Add the flour, salt, sugar and butter over the wet ingredients, and mix gently to get the salt away from the surface.
- Add the yeast
- Mix on slow for 5 minutes (until combined)
- Increase the mixer speed for 10 minutes until silky and the dough comes away cleanly.
- Form dough into a ball, cover and leave for 45 minutes (double in size).
- Tip onto a lightly floured worktop, and roll out to an A3-sized rectangle.
- "Make the filling: beat the butter and sugar until pale. Stir in the cinnamon."
- Spread the filling over the dough.
- Grease a 12-cup muffin tray
- Fold in half lengthways. Then slice widthways into 12 long-thin strips each ~35mm wide.
- Take each strip and make 2 addition cuts 80% of the length of the strip to allow plaiting.
- Plait a strip, then roll it up along the length to create a knot and place it in the greased muffin tray.
- Cover and leave to prove for 1 hour.
- Preheat the oven to 200Â°C.
- Brush the knots with egg glaze and bake for 15-20 minutes until golden.
- Meanwhile, make the sugar glaze. Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat and simmer until you have a light syrup.
- Brush the baked knots with the syrup while still hot and leave to cool.
