categories: [Bread]
description: "Ciabatta dough is extremely wet, so difficult to make by hand, but if
  you have a freestanding mixer it's simple. Don't be tempted to add more flour or
  rush the prove as it will spoil the the texture of the finished loaf.\r\n\r\nEquipment
  and preparation: for this recipe you will need a freestanding mixer with a dough
  hook attachment and a 3 litre/5¼pint square plastic container with a lid."

recipeIngredient:
- 500g/1lb 2oz strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 10g/⅓oz salt
- 10g/⅓oz instant yeast
- fine semolina, for dusting
recipeInstructions:
- 'Put the flour, salt and yeast with 330ml/11fl oz cold water into a freestanding
  mixer fitted with a dough hook (don’t put the salt directly on top of the yeast).
  Begin mixing on a slow speed. '
- As the dough starts to come together, with the motor running, slowly add another
  110ml/3⅓fl oz of cold water, drip by drip. Mix for a further 5-8 minutes on a medium
  speed until the dough is smooth and stretchy.
- Lightly oil a 3 litre/5¼pint square plastic container with a lid. (It’s important
  to use a square tub as it helps shape the dough).
- Tip the dough into the oiled container and seal with the lid. Leave for 1½ to 1¾
  hours at room temperature, or until at least doubled, even trebled in size (it's
  important the dough proves slowly, otherwise it will collapse and your loaves will
  be flat).
- 'Dust two large baking trays with flour and semolina. '
- 'Dust your work surface heavily with flour and semolina and carefully tip out the
  dough (it will be very wet) - trying to retain a rough square shape. '
- 'Rather than knocking it back, handle it gently so you can keep as much air in the
  dough as possible. Coat the top of the dough with more flour and/or semolina. '
- 'Cut the dough lengthways, dividing into four equally-sized loaves. Stretch each
  piece of dough lengthways a little and place on the prepared baking trays. Leave
  the ciabatta to rest for a further 30-45 minutes.  '
- Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 8 (200C fan) and bake for 25 minutes, or until
  the loaves are golden-brown and sound hollow when tapped on the base. Leave to cool
  completely on a wire rack before serving.
