categories: [Bread]
description: "Ciabatta dough is extremely wet, so difficult to make by hand, but if
  you have a freestanding mixer it's simple. Don't be tempted to add more flour or
  rush the prove as it will spoil the the texture of the finished loaf.\r\n\r\nEquipment
  and preparation: for this recipe you will need a freestanding mixer with a dough
  hook attachment and a 3 litre/5¼pint square plastic container with a lid."

recipeYield: Makes 4 small loaves

recipeIngredient:
- 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 10g salt
- 20g fresh yeast (or 10g instant yeast)
- fine semolina, for dusting
- 440ml cold water

recipeInstructions:
- Add the flour, salt and yeast with 330ml cold water to a mixer bowl. Mix with a dough hook at slow speed until it starts to come together.
- Turn the mixer up to medium. Slowly add the remaining 110ml water. **It will be wet!**. You might not need all the additional water, so stop if it's nearing a batter. Mix for 8-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and stretchy.
- Lightly oil a 3 litre square plastic container with a lid and tip the dough in. Leave to prove for 1½ to 2 hours, until at least doubled (maybe trebled). From Paul Hollywood: it's important the dough proves slowly, otherwise it will collapse and your loaves will be flat.
- Dust two large baking trays and the work surface with flour and semolina.
- Tip out the dough trying to retain a rough square shape. Keep as much air in the dough as possible. Sprinkle semonlina over the top of the dough.
- Cut the dough lengthways into 4 pieces. Stretch each loaf lengthways, and place on the baking tray.
- Leave to rest for 30-45 minutes.
- Preheat the oven to 220C
- Bake for 25 minutes, when they should be golden and sound hollow.
- Leave to cool completely.
