  Barbacoa marinade:
    - 2 pork, fennel and chilli sausages, meat squeezed out of the casings and roughly chopped
    - 2 tbsp olive oil
    - 1 (400g) tin finely chopped tomatoes
    - 400g short pasta, such as fusilli, penne, mafalda corta or orecchiette
    - 125g mascarpone
    - Â½ whole nutmeg (approx.), grated

recipeInstructions:
- In a pan, fry the sausage meat in the olive oil over a medium-high heat for 5 mins, until just browning.
- Stir in the chopped tomatoes, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 10 mins, or until thickened and rich. Season to taste.
- Meanwhile, cook the pasta as per the pack instructions.
- Stir the mascarpone and nutmeg into the tomato mix, heat through for a couple of mins, then check the seasoning.
